Firstly, choose B go to group A (extends the least)
// The mbr of group A: (1, 1), (5, 6)
Secondly choose E go to group A (extends the lease)
// The mbr of group A: (1, 1), (6, 7)
Finally, C will go to group D (following the constraint of minimum entries in each node)
// The mbr of group D: (6, 2), (9, 9)
